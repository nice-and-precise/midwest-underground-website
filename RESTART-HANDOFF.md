## üö® CRITICAL STATUS: UI ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### Current Problem:
- **Page showing completely blank/black screen** in browser
- User reported: "its not showing see the screenshot"
- Screenshot showed empty black page with only DevTools visible
- HTML body tag present but no content rendering

### What Just Happened:
1. Completed dark mode contrast fixes (successful - committed to git)
2. Fixed all Next.js 15 async params errors (successful - committed to git)
3. Created comprehensive documentation (successful)
4. Made git commit: `6425f2f - feat: Complete dark mode contrast fixes and Next.js 15 compliance`
5. User tried to view site at http://localhost:3006 - **PAGE WAS BLANK**
6. I cleared .next cache and restarted server
7. Server now running on **http://localhost:3007** (port changed due to multiple instances)

### Current Server Status:
- **Running on port 3007** (not 3006!)
- Fresh cache cleared
- Clean restart completed
- Waiting for user to test at new port

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS AFTER RESTART:

### Step 1: Verify Page Loading
1. Check if http://localhost:3007 is working
2. If still blank, check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Look for hydration errors, component errors, or runtime issues

### Step 2: Identify UI Issues
User mentioned "more UI issues to resolve" - need to:
1. Ask user what specific UI issues they're seeing
2. Get screenshots of problems
3. Check dark mode contrast on actual pages
4. Verify all components rendering correctly

### Step 3: Fix Issues
Based on what's found:
- Fix JavaScript errors if any
- Fix component rendering issues
- Fix styling/contrast problems
- Test thoroughly before committing

## üîç DEBUGGING BLANK PAGE ISSUE:

### Possible Causes:
1. **JavaScript Runtime Error** - Check browser console
2. **Hydration Mismatch** - Next.js client/server mismatch
3. **CSS Issue** - Background covering content
4. **Component Crash** - React error boundary triggered
5. **Missing Dependencies** - npm packages not installed

### Files to Check:
1. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
2. `src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage
3. `src/app/globals.css` - Global styles
4. `src/components/ParallaxHero.tsx` - Hero component
5. Browser DevTools Console - Error messages

### Commands to Run:
```bash
# Check server output
# (Should be running on port 3007 after restart)

# Check for errors
npm run build

# If needed, restart fresh
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```
