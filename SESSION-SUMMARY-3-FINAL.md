---

## Key Learnings

1. **Mock Data is Powerful:** Having realistic mock data makes pages feel complete and helps visualize the final product

2. **Consistent Patterns:** Reusing the same layout patterns (hero sections, card grids, data tables) speeds up development significantly

3. **Component Reusability:** ParallaxSection demonstrates how creating reusable components pays off immediately

4. **TypeScript Benefits:** Type safety caught several issues during development

5. **Next.js App Router:** The file-based routing makes it incredibly fast to create new pages

6. **CSS Custom Properties:** Using CSS variables makes theming and consistent styling trivial

---

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Cache Issues:** Had to clear .next directory to resolve compilation errors
2. **Logo Sizing:** Required research into industry best practices
3. **Parallax Performance:** Needed RAF throttling and GPU acceleration
4. **Mobile Menu State:** Client component required careful state management
5. **Data Structures:** Designed realistic data models for all 8 modules
